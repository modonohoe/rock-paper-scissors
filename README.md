********************

## **Project Goals**
---
### **Site Owner Goals**
* To host a clean, responsive and engaging game and create a consistent and positive user experience across all devices.

### **How This Will Be Achieved**
* The site will be one page with clear instructions and feedback given to the user at all times (e.g. when hovering the mouse, on clicking, results for each round etc)
* Dimensions for an extensive list of screen sizes will be tested.

## **UX**
---
### **Strategy and Scope**

#### **User Stories**
As a user I would like:
* Minimal text for instructions.
* A clean and easthetically pleasing interface, with game sounds and music.
* A functioning game with consitent outcomes that is enjoyable with no delays or lagging.
* To be able to see my score and have a target.
* To have the option to play again easily.


#### **User Requirements**
| Requirements        | Importance           | Viability  |
| ------------- |:-----:| -----:|
| Game rules    | 5 | 5 |
| Computer Challenger     | 5 | 5 |
| Human Challenger | 5 | 3 |
| Score tally | 5 | 5 |
| Human Challenger | 5 | 3 |
| Interactive buttons for game choices     | 5 | 5 |
| Feedback comment after each round | 4 | 5 |
| Disable buttons when game ends | 5 | 5 |
| Restart button | 5 | 5 |
| Music | 4 | 4 |

For this iteration all requirements with importance and viability score of 5 have been implemented. In the next version I would like to source some game music to add to the experience. Based on feedback from testers, the option to play against a friend/stranger emerged as important but not viable at present. Comments are not essential for functioning of the game (as the score bar updates shows who is winning) but it is a nice form of feedback and engagement for the user. 
Initially the choice buttons displayed as text but feedback from testers suggested these be replaced with icons as they were more attractive. This has been implemented.
