## **Project Goals**

### **Site Owner Goals**

- To host a clean, responsive and engaging game and create a consistent and positive user experience across all devices.

### **How This Will Be Achieved**

- The site will be one page with clear instructions and feedback given to the user at all times (e.g. when hovering the mouse, on clicking, results for each round etc)
- Dimensions for an extensive list of screen sizes will be tested.

---

## **UX**

### **Strategy and Scope**

#### **User Stories**

As a user I would like:

- Minimal text for instructions.
- A clean and aesthetically pleasing interface, with game sounds and music.
- A functioning game with consitent outcomes that is enjoyable with no delays or lagging.
- To be able to see my score and have a target.
- To have the option to play again easily.

#### **User Requirements**

| Requirements                         | Importance | Viability |
| ------------------------------------ | :--------: | --------: |
| Game rules                           |     5      |         5 |
| Computer Challenger                  |     5      |         5 |
| Human Challenger                     |     5      |         3 |
| Score tally                          |     5      |         5 |
| Interactive buttons for game choices |     5      |         5 |
| Feedback comment after each round    |     4      |         5 |
| Disable buttons when game ends       |     5      |         5 |
| Restart button                       |     5      |         5 |
| Music                                |     4      |         4 |

For this iteration, all requirements with importance and viability score of 5 have been implemented.

In the next version I would like to source some game music to add to the experience. Based on feedback from testers, the option to play against a friend/stranger emerged as important but not viable at present.

Comments are not essential for functioning of the game (as the score bar updates and shows who is winning) but it is a nice form of feedback and engagement for the user.

Initially the choice buttons displayed as text but feedback from testers suggested these be replaced with icons as they were more attractive. This has been implemented.

Buttons before:

### **Structure and Skeleton**

#### **Wireframe**

![Wireframe for Rock Paper Scissors](assets/images/wireframe-pc-and-mobile.jpg "Wireframe image")

#### **Current Features**

##### **1. Header**

- Displays the game title 'Rock Paper Scissors', in large contrasted text.

![Header](assets/images/documentation/header.jpg "Header")

##### **2. Rules**

- A reminder of the rules featuring some FontAwesome icons.

![Game Rules](assets/images/documentation/rules.jpg "Game rules")

##### **3. Game Area**

- Here the player will interact with the buttons to make their choices. JavaScript will generate choices for the computer player.

- The player update div will give live commentary on who is winning by test while the score updates below in purple font to make it stand out.

- Communication is clear and consise to the player.

![Game Area](assets/images/documentation/game-area.jpg "Game Area")

##### **4. Game Over**

- When the round is won - a new button appears with the option to resart the game.

![End of Game](assets/images/documentation/end-game.jpg "End of Game")

##### **5. Footer**

- The footer is 'sticky', it gives a solid bottom to the page. A link to my GitHub page is there if the user wishes to visit the repository.

![Footer](assets/images/documentation/footer.jpg "Page footer")

### **Surface**

#### **Color Scheme**

The basic CSS colors: 'thistle', 'indigo' and 'papaywhite' were used to compliment the colors of the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' image (colors identified using [Adobe Color Image](https://color.adobe.com/create/image).)

![Colors](assets/images/documentation/color-scheme.jpg "Color scheme")

#### **Font**

Both 'sans-serif' fonts, 'Chelsea Market' (for headings) and 'Belanosima''(for player updates) come from Google Fonts.

---

## **Testing and Validation**

- I tested the game in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
- The game has been tested on multiple mobile devices in person and via all the available devices on Dev Tools toolbar.
- I confirmed the fonts, colors and all text items are clear, adequately contrasted, legible and easy to understand.
- Initially LightHouse returned a score of 98% as I skipped the use of 'h2' headings and began using 'h3'. This was flagged as bad practice for screen readers and all headings below 'h1' were amended.

### **Bugs**

#### **Solved Bugs**

- I had an issues with my JavaScript syntax which cause my array items not to show. The error was using curved parentheses instead of square ones and this was easily addressed.

- When defining statements to toggle the display, the following did not work:

![Syntax Issue](assets/images/documentation/syntax-order.png "Syntax order issues")

Only when the dashboard statement was defined above the restart statement was the display affected.

- In the restartGame function, player and computer images needed to be re-sourced as without explicitly doing so resulted in the following error:

![Restarting Issue](assets/images/documentation/restarting-image-issue.png "Restarting image issue")

- At one stage, the computer could not score against player - I did not document this well enough but I think it was another paretheses issue. It has been resolved.

![Computer can't Score](assets/images/documentation/no-computer-wins.png "Computer scoring issue")

- The hover effects still appears when a button is disabled. I found this bad for UX and as the buttons were no longer needed after the game ends I chose to hide them instead.

![Hover issue](assets/images/documentation/hover-appearing.png "Hover when buttons disabled")

- For most devices, the game will fill the height of the screen. There are a couple of shorter devices - namely the Google Nest Hub - where the sticky footer became an issue and overlapped/hid the scores. This was resolved with a media query where the display was changed to 'relative' on such devices.

#### **Validator testing**

- HTML

  - One error found - the script tag for the JavaScript file was outside of the body. It should always be at the end of the page for loading reasons but within the body element.

  ![Script HTML issue](assets/images/documentation/script-error.jpg "HTML script error")

  This has been addressed and no there are no HTML errors.

- CSS
  - No errors found

#### **Unfixed bugs**

- There are no unfixed bugs.

## **Deployment and Development**

The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab from the horizontal menu at the top of the page.
2. Click the Settings tab and locate the Pages tab on the left menu which appears.
3. Once you've selected your branch and root directory, click "Save" to deploy your website. GitHub will generate a URL (usually in the format username.github.io/repository-name).
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
